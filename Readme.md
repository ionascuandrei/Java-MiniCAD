# MiniCAD
Graphic drawing engine based on simple geometric shapes, easy to draw and handle, which can be manipulated in the design of complex drawings by composing shapes, giving the result as PNG. In the implementation I used Visitor, Factory and Singleton patterns.
Personal gains:
-	understanding the concepts of Design Patterns: Visitor, Factory and Singleton
-	understanding the grounds of building and drawing elements in CAD software
-	deepening the notions of inheritance, aggregation and interfacing in the context of OOP

Programming language/libraries/tools used: Java, Desing Patterns
